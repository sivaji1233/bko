                </div>
                <div class="about-content">
                    <p style="font-size:18px;">Our Client, a large Independent Power Producer, wanted to improve the power generation marketing for the plants. This would optimize the future commercial value of the power plants. The challenge is that a typical plant might have 288 different generation points, each has its own revenue and cost. Those 288 daily offers are tied to the operational profile of the equipment and vary with weather and equipment changes. Until now our client was relying on no more than outdated curve on a spreadsheet. This created an opportunity to vastly improve the overall profit from power generation.</p>

                    <h2>Solution</h2>
                    <p>Modern Power Plants are very efficient so are the de-regulated markets they operate in. With all that efficiency, complexity has come along for the ride. In a deregulated power market, most plants can offer their generation capabilities and their costs to a clearing house called Day Ahead Market, DAM.To address the  modeling complexity, we created a power generation marketing and planning system for each plant centered around machine learning model representations of the plants.The end result was a robust process that improved the enterprise financial goals through optimized power plant dispatching and generation planning.</p>

                    <h2>Approach</h2>
                    <p>Our approach was to create a two- step solution. 1)Use Machine Learning and Thermodynamics Simulations to create a digital twin representation of each plant capabilities 2) Build an interface for plant operators to forecast future generation capabilities based on local weather forecast. Results are then shared with energy dispatchers to monetize those capabilities.</p>

                    <h2>Data Cleansing</h2>
                    <p>Production Preprocessing: For a variety of reasons, not all data is meaningful. Armed with the understanding in step 1 (data exploration), we identified the highest quality data needed for the analysis. We also Computed an economic BOE = Oil + 1.1*Gas / 20, Accumulated volumes and “days online” and Interpolated data to a consistent “Cum Oil At 365 Days”</p>

		                <p>For most generators this sort of forecasting of the plant capabilities can be out of reach. To make this scalable we designed a turnkey solution that went from plant data collection all the way to dispatch interface and automation of generation planning process . We implemented a monitoring process that made those models adaptive and therefore increased the fidelity of the generation forecasting.</p>
