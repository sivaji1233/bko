Remote Monitoring as a Service (RMAAS)
BKO Services offers remote monitoring of power generation plant.
Particularly useful for generation asset owners who don’t want to hire control engineers, have limited
access to them, or cannot justify the cost, based on the asset size.
One of our engineers can monitor multiple assets from multiple owners, achieving significant benefits of
scale.
Services fall into three broad categories:
 Monitoring for abnormality detection.
 Monitoring for maintenance optimization.
 Monitoring for performance improvement and cost reduction.

BKO Services will work with any client-side hardware or software, bringing you the benefits that come
from monitoring by skilled engineers, analysis using Machine Learning, and reporting from data stored
in Modern Real-Time databases, and Cloud technologies.
BKO Services can remotely inspect your Historian, and even your PLC’s to make sure that initial data
feed is correct and complete, and make recommendations for additions of sensors, or virtual metering,
depending on objectives.
