                <div class="about-content">
                    <p style="font-size:18px;">Our Client, an energy company focused on producing and providing LNG, wanted to improve their sales engagement with their clients. This would help them improve their sales process and customer engagement. The client wanted to show prospective clients a life like experience of what it takes to own and operate LNG processing plants.Until then our client was relying on no more than outdated power points. This created an opportunity to vastly improve the value from each sales engagement.</p>

                    <h2>Solution</h2>
                    <p>It’s expected that our work will transform our client’s sales presentation to their customers and will be attributed with helping our client close the sale for some of their LNG plants. The solution BKO Services developed was to build and deploy a modern 3D Sales Model application. The model starts with a zoomed-out aerial view of the customer site, and project an image of LNG equipment configuration on the aerial image. The application allows the user to zoom in on the aerial image and arrive to “street view” and walk the site.</p>

                    <h2>Customer Application</h2>
                    <p>The goal of the Customer Application is to deliver a polished 3D Sales Model presentation to the customer. The basic model will start with a zoomed-out aerial view of the customer site. The application will project an image of client’s equipment configuration on the aerial image. Users can zoom in on the aerial image and get to 3D sales model image “street view”. Users will be able to continue to zoom in, and navigate 360 degrees around the 3D template.</p>

The User Interface will enable client sales employees to enter all relevant data into a display. Once information is entered and submitted, the application will essentially build a new plant model each time. Once created, the plant model will exist for use throughout the customer sales process.</p>

                    <p>BKO Services built an innovative digital solution that optimized business development for an LNG Client. Gone are the days when the sales team have to explain to their customers what this new multimillion dollar LNG investment is going to provide. They simply now show their customers what their new plant will look like, where it will be located and take them on a journey to interact with their equipment.</p>
