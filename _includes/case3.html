    <h4>Challenge</h4>
    <p>
        Our Client, a large Independent Power Producer, wanted to improve the power generation 
        marketing for the plants. This would optimize the future commercial value of the power 
        plants. The challenge is that a typical plant might have 288 different generation points, 
        each has its own revenue and cost. Those 288 daily offers are tied to the operational 
        profile of the equipment and vary with weather and equipment changes. Until now our 
        client was relying on no more than outdated curve on a spreadsheet. This created an 
        opportunity to vastly improve the overall profit from power generation.

        <h4>Solution</h4>
        <p>Modern Power Plants are very efficient so are the de-regulated markets they operate in. 
            With all that efficiency, complexity has come along for the ride. In a deregulated 
            power market, most plants can offer their generation capabilities and their costs to 
            a clearing house called Day Ahead Market, DAM.To address the  modeling complexity, we 
            created a power generation marketing and planning system for each plant centered around 
            machine learning model representations of the plants.The end result was a robust process 
            that improved the enterprise financial goals through optimized power plant dispatching 
            and generation planning.

            <h4>Approach</h4>
            <p>
                Our approach was to create a two- step solution.
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <p>
                            Use Machine Learning and Thermodynamics Simulations to create a digital twin representation of each plant capabilities.
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>
                            Build an interface for plant operators to forecast future generation capabilities based on local weather forecast.
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <p>Results are then shared with energy dispatchers to monetize those capabilities.</p>
                </ul>
            </p>
        </div>
        <h4>Data Cleansing</h4>
        <p>
            Production Preprocessing: For a variety of reasons, not all data is meaningful. Armed with 
            the understanding in step 1 (data exploration), we identified the highest quality data needed 
            for the analysis. We also Computed an economic BOE = Oil + 1.1*Gas / 20, Accumulated volumes 
            and “days online” and Interpolated data to a consistent “Cum Oil At 365 Days”
        </p>

        </div>
        <h4>User Interface</h4>
        <p>
            The goal of the User Interface is to customize the Customer Application so it is tailored to each customer’s 
            configuration. The User Interface will enable client sales employees to enter all relevant data into a 
            display. Once information is entered and submitted, the application will essentially build a new plant 
            model each time. Once created, the plant model will exist for use throughout the customer sales process.
        </p>

        </div>
        <p>
            For most generators this sort of forecasting of the plant capabilities can be out of reach. To make this 
            scalable we designed a turnkey solution that went from plant data collection all the way to dispatch interface 
            and automation of generation planning process . We implemented a monitoring process that made those models 
            adaptive and therefore increased the fidelity of the generation forecasting.

        <h4>Conclusion</h4>
        <p>
            BKO Services designed and built a machine learning based solution for an Independent Power Producer 
            that will enable the IPP to improve profitability by several millions of dollars annually.
